# Web Page Development

## Summary
I found coding very interesting. I wanted to find a somewhat interesting form of code, so in my sophomore year at Lindenwood University, I registered for a web design class. For our final project, we were tasked with creating a website for a business or service of our choice and implementing all the tactaics, so I decided to create a website for a clothing company. 

## Project Planning
- Defined key individual responsibilities, developed wireframes, and identifying proper steps for deployment

### Plan:
- Defined proper layout and functions


### Build:
- Weeks of coding, testing, and iterating, to develop core features necessary for the website.
- Integrate outside functions and APIs _(i.e. Google Login)_
